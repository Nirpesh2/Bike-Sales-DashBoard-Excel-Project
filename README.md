# Bike-Sales-DashBoard-Excel-Project
---
## Overview
This project presents an interactive Bike Sales Dashboard created in Microsoft Excel to analyze sales trends based on various customer attributes. The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as income per purchase, customer age brackets, commute distance, and purchase patterns using slicers and dynamic charts.

## Project Files

## Process
-Removed duplicates using Excel's "Remove Duplicates" feature to ensure data integrity and accuracy in analysis.
- Replaced abbreviations with full words (e.g., "m" to "married", "s" to "single") using Find and Replace with "Match Case" and "Search by Columns" options for clearer data representation.
- Standardized currency values to a consistent format (numeric or currency) for accurate calculations and visualizations.
- Created pivot tables by selecting the entire data range and choosing fields for Rows, Columns, and Values to build a foundation for dashboard visualizations
- Used "Value Field Settings" to change aggregation from sum to average for specific fields, allowing for more meaningful data interpretation.
- Leveraged pivot tables' ability to switch between different aggregation levels and grouping criteria for comprehensive data insights.
- Utilized "Recommended Charts" to create visualizations like bar charts with axis and chart titles for at-a-glance understanding.
- Built a cohesive dashboard by creating a pivot table sheet, copying visualizations to separate sheets, and merging cells for visual appeal.
